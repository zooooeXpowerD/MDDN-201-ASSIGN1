		<h1><p>What is 'Fitting'</p></h1>
		
        <h2>
		<p>‘Fitting’ is a platform that uses the AR (augmented reality) technology to realise the virtual fitting of a variety of garments online, try to provide costumers a different shopping experience as before. Based on this application, people could stay at home but have the same feeling of visiting a physical clothes store. The real fitting and avatar fitting functions just make people more enjoyable when trying on different outfits at home. It can easily mix and match different fashion styles conveniently and present real-time 3D virtual fitting that overlays on costumers’ reflection.</p>

        <p>The platform needs to cooperate with numbers of brands in the market, no matter domestic or overseas. According to the clear picture of both the front and back of each garment that needs to be provided by the brand retailers, this 3D virtual technology works on the platform and application. When costumers have satisfied clothes after fitting, they could click the product link and go to the original brand website to purchase online.</p>

        <p>The inspiration for creating ‘Fitting’ was from COVID - 19. In 2020, a sudden outbreak of an unknown virus spread around the world, given state and local government mandates and school closings, more and more individuals are limited to home and have increased reliance on the internet for up-to-date information, community support, and entertainment. During the lockdown, there was an obvious increase in the usages of social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and so on. Video with different people seemed to be the only way to connect with friends and families from different bubbles. Meanwhile, people began to change the way of consumption and try online shopping more often. However the online shopping environment is not very mature, people are always worried a lot about unseen products, especially regards to cloths. Even the discounts one the site are enticing, people still so hesitate about buying garments online, for they cannot see the real one, don’t know whether it fits, or just cannot see what they’re wearing through the mirror. Therefore, the arrival of ‘Fitting’ improves users’ online shopping experience, provides better services, and bring more fun as well.</p>

        <p>‘Fitting’ not only benefit customers, but also the fashion industry and the market. Due to the COVID - 19, the sales of the clothing industry is not very optimistic, for fewer customers are coming into the physical store. Thus, ’Fitting’ is providing a new innovative marketing solution for fashion companies, for online shopping may become a popular trend resulted from the uncontrollable nature of the virus. It is a win-win that can increase sales and reduce layoffs, but also meet the customers’ demands. Furthermore, both companies and designers could have a better understanding of customer preferences and shopping propensity of the new market by deep data management, which collected from the ‘Fitting’ platform.</p></h2>
